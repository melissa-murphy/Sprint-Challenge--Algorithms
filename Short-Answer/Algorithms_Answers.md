#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) The same number of operations have to run, regardless of input, until it hits the upper limit of the while loop


b) O(n^2) Like the previous while loop, except nested - which doubles the operations

c) O(n) This is recursive, so it will call as long as there are bunnies, thus directly proportional

## Exercise II
